        Hey! I'm <Link href="https://twitter.com/imd_js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dain</Link>, a software engineer based in the US. <strong>LoL Decay Tracker</strong> is a project I started because I was tired of logging into every single one of my accounts just to check how many decay days I had left. After some encouragement from friends, I decided to build this tool for myselfâ€”and for anyone else who finds decay tracking a pain.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Here's how it works: LoL Decay Tracker uses the Riot API to mimic the way the in-game decay system works. Since Riot doesn't provide decay numbers directly, you'll need to input your initial decay days manually. From there, the app keeps track for you.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        With that said--the app isn't perfect. For some reason, the decay refresh time isn't exactly midnight every night, but rather fluctuates between 30 to 40 minutes after midnight. Also, remade games are <strong>NOT</strong> counted towards bank decay days, and yet the Riot API doesn't have an exact flag for remade games. I tried to use the game duration to manually detect remade games, but it's more of a band-aid fix. If any of these inconsistencies occur, you'll have to manually update the decay days yourself. But also, if this ever happens, please let me know. I want to make this as consistent as possible.
